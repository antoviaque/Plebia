$ ./plebia/manage.py schemamigration wall --auto ; ./plebia/manage.py migrate wall


= 4. Quick completion test for a list of series =

* In plebia/settings_local.py add/edit the TEST_SERIES_LIST to set your list of series 
  (see plebia/settings.py for how to use the setting)

* Run the test (can take some time depending on the number of series):

    $ ./plebia/manage.py test wall.PlebiaTest.test_series_processing

* Monitor test through the log file log/server.log

* Upon completion, use the following command to load a test server with the state of the
  database upon completion of the tests (json file path configured with the 
  TEST_DB_DUMP_PATH setting, which can be overriden in settings_local.py)

    $ ./plebia/manage.py testserver /tmp/plebia_test_db.json

* Point your browser to the status page from the server you just launched, for example:

    http://127.0.0.1:8000/status/
